	Completing this project required that we develop a simulation of an assembly line with any number of stations. This project out my C++ Object Oriented skills to the test and required that I use the skills learned though out the semester. One part of this project that caused me difficulties was coding the extractToken function located in the Utilities Module. The function parses string data from input files into tokens. I had to code a function removeSpaces to help with formatting the parsed strings. The extractToken function is important to the project and is used throughout. Another part of this workshop that I found difficult was the fillItem function in the CustomerOrder module. After completing milestone 2, I thought the fillItem function was correct as it passed the milestone 2 submission test. However, when working in milestone 3 I had problems with my output and the items did not appear to be filled correctly. It took me a long time to find the issue as it was in the fillItem function that I completed in milestone 2. It was a good lesson in debugging and the importance of thoroughly testing my code to ensure it is correct. By completing this project, I got a lot of practise working with containers. The Workstaion module uses three deque constrainers to hold and process customer orders and the LineManager Module uses a vector to hold a collection of workstations for the current assembly line.
